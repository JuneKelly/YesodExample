Yesod Example
=============

This is a (very) simple Yesod todo-list application.

- MongoDB backend
- HashDB Auth
- Gravatars
- Bootstrap integration
- Basic CRUD operations on User accounts, Todo lists and Tasks

The purpose of this repo is to show an example of a scaffolded Yesod 
site with some functionality beyond that of the examples in 
the (excellent) Yesod Book.
